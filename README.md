# Student_Success_Predictor_LogReg
A Flask web application utilizing a Logistic Regression model to predict student dropouts based on various factors. Incorporates data preprocessing and addresses class imbalance with SMOTE. Simply input student details to get a prediction.

Student Dropout Prediction System

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a student dropping out based on various factors. By leveraging machine learning techniques and a comprehensive dataset, we've developed a model that provides insights into student behavior, helping educational institutions take timely actions to prevent dropouts.

Features:

Utilizes a Logistic Regression model for binary classification.
Incorporates data preprocessing techniques like feature scaling and one-hot encoding.
Uses the SMOTE technique to address class imbalance in the dataset.
Deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing easy input of student data and displaying the prediction outcome.
How to Use:

Navigate to the web application.
Enter the student's details into the provided form.
Click "Predict" to see the model's prediction.

NOTE: you need to configure this code for your device.
