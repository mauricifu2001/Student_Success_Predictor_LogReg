# Student_Success_Predictor_LogReg
Machine Learning Web App for Predicting Student Academic Outcomes using Logistic Regression. Built with Flask, trained on a real-world dataset.

# More details
This project presents an interactive web application built using Flask, aimed at predicting student academic outcomes. The primary goal is to aid educational institutions by providing them insights into potential student dropouts or successes. Various personal and academic factors serve as input features, which include details such as age, gender, nationality, previous academic performance, socio-economic indicators, and more.

The core prediction engine of the application is a Logistic Regression model. This model was trained on a real-world dataset that captures diverse student profiles. By understanding the patterns in this data, the model aims to make accurate predictions about a student's likelihood to graduate or drop out.

By integrating this model into a user-friendly web interface, educational institutions or concerned stakeholders can easily input student data and receive instant predictions. This can be crucial for early interventions, helping institutions take proactive measures to ensure student success.
